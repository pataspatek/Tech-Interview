# Tech Interview Questions

This repository contains a collection of common technical interview questions that cover a range of topics including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving. The questions are sorted by difficulty, making it easy for you to find and practice questions based on your skill level.

Each question includes a detailed solution implemented in Python, making it easy for you to understand and apply the concepts in this language. As time goes on, we plan to add solutions in additional programming languages, such as Java, C++, and JavaScript.

Whether you're preparing for a technical interview or looking to improve your coding skills, this repository is an excellent resource to help you enhance your problem-solving abilities and master technical concepts. With solutions in multiple programming languages, you can learn to solve these problems in a variety of different ways, and build your coding skills in multiple languages.
